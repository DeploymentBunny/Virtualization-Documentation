# Introduction to Hyper-V on Windows 10

Whether you are a software developer, an IT professional, or a technology enthusiast, many of you need to run multiple operating systems.  Instead of dedicating physical hardware to each of your machines, Hyper-V lets you run multiple operating systems on your Windows computer as virtual machines (VMs).

> Microsoft Virtual PC will be reaching end of life in April 2017. Hyper-V on Windows 10 Enterprise and Windows 10 Professional will be the supported replacement.  

## Reasons to use virtualization
Virtualization enables anyone to run multiple operating systems, software configurations, and hardware configurations on the same physical machine.  Hyper-V provides both virtualization and the tools to manage your virtual machines.

Hyper-V can be used in many ways. For example:

* Run software that requires an older versions of Windows or non-Windows operating systems. 

* Experiment with other operating systems. Hyper-V makes it very easy to create and remove different operating systems.

* Test software on multiple operating systems using multiple virtual machines. With Hyper-V, you can run them all on a single desktop or laptop computer. These virtual machines can be exported and then imported into any other Hyper-V system, including Azure.

* Troubleshoot virtual machines from any Hyper-V deployment. You can export a virtual machine from your production environment, open it on your desktop running Hyper-V, troubleshoot your virtual machine, and then export it back into the production environment. 

* Using virtual networking, you can create a multi-machine environment for test/development/demonstration while ensuring that it won't affect the production network.

## System requirements
Hyper-V is only available in Windows Professional, Enterprise, and Education editions of Windows 8 and greater.

It requires a 64-bit system that has Second Level Address Translation (SLAT). SLAT is a feature present in the current generation of 64-bit processors by Intel and AMD.  Youâ€™ll also need a 64-bit version of Windows.  
With that said, Hyper-V does support both 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems inside the virtual machines.

You can run 3 or 4 basic virtual machines on a host that has 4GB of RAM, though you'll need more resources for more virtual machines. On the other end of the spectrum, you can also create large virtual machines with 32 processors and 512GB RAM, depending on your physical hardware.

For more information about Hyper-V's system requirements and how to verify that Hyper-V runs on your machine, see [Walkthrough: Windows 10 Hyper-V System Requirements](..\quick_start\walkthrough_install.md).


## Operating systems you can run in a virtual machine
The term "guest" refers to a virtual machine and "host" refers to the computer running the virtual machine. Hyper-V on Windows supports many different guest operating systems including various releases of Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows. 

As a reminder, you'll need to have a valid license for any operating systems you use in the VMs. 

For information about which operating systems are supported as guests in Hyper-V on Windows, see [Supported Windows Guest Operating Systems](supported_guest_os.md) and [Linux and FreeBSD Virtual Machines on Hyper-V](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn531030.aspx). 


## Differences between Hyper-V on Windows and Hyper-V on Windows Server
There are some features that work differently in Hyper-V on Windows than they do in Hyper-V running on Windows Server. 

The memory management model is different for Hyper-V on Windows. On a server, Hyper-V memory is managed with the assumption that only the virtual machines are running on the server. In Hyper-V on Windows, memory is managed with the expectation that most client machines are running software on host in addition to running virtual machines. For example, a developer might be running Visual Studio as well as several virtual machines on the same computer.

### Hyper-V features available in Windows Server only
There are some features included in Hyper-V on Windows Server that are not included in Hyper-V on Windows. These include:

* Virtualizing GPUs using RemoteFX 
* Live migration of virtual machines from one host to another
* Hyper-V Replica
* Virtual Fiber Channel
* SR-IOV networking
* Shared .VHDX

## Limitations
Using virtualization does have limitations. Features or applications that depend on specific hardware will not work well in a virtual machine. For example, games or applications that require processing with GPUs might not work well. Also, applications relying on sub-10ms timers such as live music mixing applications or high precision times could have issues running in a virtual machine.

In addition, if you have Hyper-V enabled, those latency-sensitive, high-precision applications may also have issues running in the host.  This is because with virtualization enabled, the host OS also runs on top of the Hyper-V virtualization layer, just as guest operating systems do. However, unlike guests, the host OS is special in that it has direct access to all the hardware, which means that applications with special hardware requirements can still run without issues in the host OS.
